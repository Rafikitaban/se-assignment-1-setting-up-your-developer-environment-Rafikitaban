# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

I downloaded VS Code at their official webiste, https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

My operating system is windows so I followed the next procedure which was running the downloaded installer, accepted the terms of agreement and intallation options and finally completed the process. 

I then launced VS Code from my windoes start menu, customized settings, installed preferred extensions and chose  theme of my liking.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

I first downloaded Git at their official website https://git-scm.com/downloads. and then configured it in my machine.

My operating system is windows so I I run the installer, customizing the settings according to my preference. I also verified my installation by using the command git --version.

I then opened the gitbash terminal and configured git by using the command git config --global user.name and git config --global user.email setting my name and email address.

I then created a github account as I visited their website https://github.com. by signing up and verifying my email address.

I then created a new repository in github and gave it a name. I also created a new directory in git bash and then run git init command to initialize a new git repository.

I then made my first commit by running the command git add, then git commit to commit the changes.

Finally I pushed my commit by running the command git push.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

I downloaded python from their official website https://www.python.org/downloads/. 

My operating system is windows so I followed the next procedure which was running the downloaded installer, accepted the terms of agreement and intallation options and finally completed the process

I then verified the version by running the command python --version in gitbash.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

Installation of python (in windows) comes by default.

To verify installation I run the command pip --version.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

I downloaded MySQL from their official website https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html. 

I then run the downloaded installer and chose my preferred components and created a password for my root account.

I then configured some server settings and executed them and once it was completed, I finished the installation process.

I proceeded again to download MySQL Workbench and configured it to my preference and finished installing it.

I then opened MySQL Workbench tool and connected MySQL server to ensure it's running properly.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

Documented in the questions above.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
